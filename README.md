🎯 Guess The Number - My First JavaScript Project
Welcome to Guess The Number, my very first JavaScript project! 🌱 This project was built as part of my learning journey to understand DOM manipulation, event handling, and basic game logic.

As an INFJ-T, I approach coding like solving a puzzle—seeking structure, logic, and meaning in every detail. This project represents not just a game, but a milestone in my development journey.

🚀 How It Works
A random number between 0 and 20 is generated at the start.
The player guesses a number and clicks Check! 🤟
The game provides feedback:
📈 Too High → Try a smaller number.
📉 Too Low → Try a bigger number.
🍹 Correct! → You win! 🎉
Each wrong guess decreases your score.
If the score hits zero, you lose. 🙊
Click Try Again to reset the game.

🛠️ Technologies Used
HTML → Structure
CSS → Styling
JavaScript → Logic & Interactivity

📌 Features
✔️ Random number generation 🔢
✔️ Interactive UI with dynamic status updates ✨
✔️ Background color change on win 🟢
✔️ Score tracking and highscore system 🏆
✔️ "Try Again" button for replayability 🔄

🤔 What I Learned
DOM Manipulation → Selecting and updating elements dynamically
Event Handling → Using .addEventListener() to respond to user actions
Game Logic → Managing conditions, loops, and user input validation

🎯 Next Steps
Now that I’ve built my first project, I plan to:
🔹 Improve error handling & UX
🔹 Add animations for better interaction 🎭
🔹 Refactor the code to make it cleaner ✍️

❤️ Special Note
This project marks my first step toward mastering JavaScript and eventually learning React.js. 🚀 If you're also on this journey, feel free to fork, explore, and suggest improvements!

Happy coding! 🎉
